aframe-terrain-plain
====================

An [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) [WebVR](https://webvr.info/) primitive that has high-resolution terrain near the origin, 
surrounded by a low-resolution plain that stretches to the horizon.
Uses equilateral triangles for efficiency.

To avoid rays on the plain, keep the terrain at the edge of the high-resolution area near zero elevation.
